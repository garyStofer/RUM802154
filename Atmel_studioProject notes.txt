IDE : AtmelStudio6.2

Target Device type:
The COORD node needs to be compiled for a ATMEL644 chip because the RAM requirement, all other nodes can be run on a ATMEl 344P or a 644
 Chips with suffix P indicate "PicoPower" and are to be used for devices on battery power that sleep most of the time.
 Atmelstudio does not allow the device type to be set in the build configuration, but rather in the project itself. file hal_avr.h checks
 for the correct device type at compile time.
 
Studio 6 Builod Configuations: Studio has a weird concept of having build configurations that belong to the project only and configs
	that belong to the solution AND the project. When creating new configurations they need to be created by the "add" in the solution 
	(topmost choice list) of the Configuration Manager and the checkbox "Create a project configuration" needs to be checked as well.
	
Settin Active Build Configuration:
		Go into configuration  Manager and either choose a new configuration under the "Active Solution Configuration" or choose a new config
		under "Project contexts" and  close the dialog.

Build:  Build Solution and Build Project seems to do the same since there is only one project with multiple configs in the solution. 
	It does not seem to be possible to batch build all the configurations in one step. Build is done with the internal build tool.

Toolchain and Library: (as installed via the Studio6 installer)
	C:\Program Files\Atmel\Atmel Toolchain\AVR8 GCC\Native\3.4.1061\avr8-gnu-toolchain\avr\include
	C:\Program Files\Atmel\Atmel Toolchain\AVR8 GCC\Native\3.4.1061\avr8-gnu-toolchain\lib\gcc\avr\4.8.1\include

Two files in avr/include needed changeing to make the code compile under this newer toolchain:
	C:\Program Files\Atmel\Atmel Toolchain\AVR8 GCC\Native\3.4.1061\avr8-gnu-toolchain\avr\include\avr\iom324p.h
	C:\Program Files\Atmel\Atmel Toolchain\AVR8 GCC\Native\3.4.1061\avr8-gnu-toolchain\avr\include\avr\iomxx4.h 
	These two modified files are copied to the project folder under the folder LIBfix but are not included in the project build at that location. 
	They need to be copied back to the original path on a new IDE installtion.

Fuses:  Atmelstudio Configurations dont hold the fuse and lockbit settings, they need to be specified in the programming GUI 
	under tools/Device Programming -- Fuses to be used are E2, B1,FD (low,high,ext)

Programming the boards : JtagICEmkII JTAG mode. Device has to be set manually in the programmer as it does not carry over from the 
	uild configurations. File hal_avr.h has checks to make sure the correct chip is used at compile time.
	
The files measure.c and measure.h in folder Sensor have been copied to t ../Sensor but excluded there from the build so that the 
Debugger and codecompletion tool can work with them.
